## ðŸ’» My Developer Journey

Hey there! Iâ€™m **Aryan Gupta**, a final-year BCA student with a strong curiosity for building real-world software. Whether itâ€™s crafting Java Swing applications, styling responsive websites, or designing MySQL schemas â€” I believe in learning by building. Iâ€™m on a mission to become a **job-ready full-stack developer** who can deploy scalable apps to the cloud.

## ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m Working On Now

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on sharpening my skills across the **full stack** â€” with a growing love for both the **frontend polish** and **backend logic**. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m diving into:

- **Frontend Development**: I enjoy building responsive UIs using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and Iâ€™m expanding into **React** to deliver dynamic interfaces. I also experiment with modern UI/UX trends and frameworks.
- **Java Swing Projects**: Iâ€™ve been working on desktop apps like **registration forms** and **MySQL-integrated applications** using **Java Swing** and **NetBeans** â€” a solid base for understanding real software flow.
- **Backend Engineering**: Learning **Node.js** and **Java Servlets**, and using **MySQL** for structured, secure data storage. I love designing efficient database schemas and connecting frontend logic to backend APIs.
- **Cloud & Deployment**: Iâ€™ve started deploying projects using **Netlify** and soon plan to work with **AWS** for real-world cloud experience.
